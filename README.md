# Himanshu-Nimbarte-NLP-Task-02
This repository contains a comprehensive solution for classifying sentences into diagnostic categories using various NLP models. The project is divided into multiple subtasks involving binary classification, multi-label classification, and fine-tuning a BERT model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is provided in the file `Problem_Dataset.csv`. This dataset contains sentences labeled with different labels.

## Solution
The solution includes:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Preparing the data for model training.
2. **Model Training:** Developing and training various models, including binary classifiers, a multi-label classifier, and a BERT model.
3. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Visualization:** Comparing model performance through plots of precision, recall, and F1-scores.

## About the Repository
The repository consists of main.ipynb file which has all the code.
There are folders assigned to each task and are named after the methods.
Each folder has predictions, metrics and saved models in Model folder.
For bert you can find the trained saved model in following link as there were restictions on GitHub.
