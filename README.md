# Himanshu-Nimbarte-NLP-Task-02
This repository contains a comprehensive solution for classifying sentences into diagnostic categories using various NLP models. The project is divided into multiple subtasks involving binary classification, multi-label classification, and fine-tuning a BERT model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is provided in the file `Problem_Dataset.csv`. This dataset contains sentences labeled with different labels.

## Solution
The solution includes:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Preparing the data for model training.
2. **Model Training:** Developing and training various models, including binary classifiers, a multi-label classifier, and a BERT model.
3. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Visualization:** Comparing model performance through plots of precision, recall, and F1-scores.

To install the dependencies, use the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
